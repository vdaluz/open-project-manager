## ⚡ Quick Start & Installation Guide

Get Open Project Manager up and running in under 2 minutes. You can run it effortlessly with **Docker Compose** (recommended for testing or self-hosting) or set up **Local Development** to contribute and customize code.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites & Required Downloads

Make sure you have the necessary tools installed for your preferred setup method:

| Tool | Required For | Recommended Version | Download / Installation Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** or Docker Engine + Compose | Docker Setup | v24+ / Compose v2+ | [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** | Local Development | v18.x or v20.x+ (LTS) | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** or **npm** | Local Development | `yarn` v1.22+ or `npm` v9+ | `npm install -g yarn` |
| **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** | Both | Any modern version | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **OpenSSL** | Both (Token Generation) | Preinstalled on macOS/Linux | Windows: Included with Git Bash |

---

### 🐳 Option 1: Docker Compose (Fastest & Recommended)

Docker Compose provides a fully isolated, zero-dependency environment with automatic SQLite database migrations and persistent volume storage.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jciccio/open-project-manager.git
cd open-project-manager
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Secret
Create a `.env` file containing a secure random secret for JWT authentication. **The application refuses to start without this**:
```bash
# macOS / Linux / Git Bash:
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env
```
*(On Windows PowerShell without OpenSSL, generate any 32+ character random string and put `JWT_SECRET=your-random-32-char-secret-string` into `.env`)*

#### Step 3: Launch Containers
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
> **How it works**: Docker Compose automatically runs the `migrate` service first (`prisma migrate deploy` against the `opm_data` volume) to initialize the SQLite database schema, then starts the web server.

#### Step 4: Seed Sample Data & Demo Accounts
Run the seed script inside the migrator container to populate initial demo accounts, columns, cards, and labels:
```bash
docker compose run --rm migrate npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

#### Step 5: Access the Application
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser!

```bash
# View live container logs:
docker compose logs -f

# Stop containers:
docker compose down
```

> 💡 **Prefer PostgreSQL?** Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d` and seed with `docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml run --rm migrate npx tsx prisma/seed.ts`. See the [Docker Deployment](#-docker-deployment) section below for details.

---

### 💻 Option 2: Local Development (Node.js & Yarn)

Follow these steps if you want to run the code locally, contribute features, or modify components.

#### Step 1: Clone Repository & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jciccio/open-project-manager.git
cd open-project-manager
yarn install
# (or: npm install)
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Secret
Create your `.env.local` configuration file with a generated JWT secret:
```bash
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env.local
```
*(Optional: see `.env.example` to configure OIDC / Single Sign-On or PostgreSQL)*

#### Step 3: Initialize the SQLite Database
Apply the Prisma database schema to your local SQLite file (`dev.db`):
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

#### Step 4: Seed Demo Accounts & Sample Projects
Populate the database with sample boards, cards, labels, and default credentials:
```bash
yarn db:seed
# (or: npx tsx prisma/seed.ts)
```

#### Step 5: Start the Development Server
```bash
yarn dev
```
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser with hot reloading enabled!

---

### 🔑 Demo Login Credentials

Once seeded (via either Docker or Local development), you can log in with the following pre-configured accounts:

| Account | Email | Password | Isolated Project / Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin Account** | `admin@example.com` | `password123` | Open Project Manager MVP |
| **Jose Account** | `jose@example.com` | `password123` | Jose's Autonomous Systems |

> ℹ️ You can also register a brand-new custom account directly from the login page (`/login`).

## 📊 System Benchmarks & Memory Load Testing

Open Project Manager is profiled using Node process memory inspecting APIs (`process.memoryUsage()`) and real-time stress testing.

### 1. Idle & Baseline Memory Metrics
| Resource / Metric | Benchmark Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Process RAM (RSS)** | **~78 MB** | Total Node.js Resident Set Size in idle state |
| **Heap Memory Used** | **~12 MB** | Active V8 JavaScript engine heap memory |
| **Heap Memory Total** | **~18 MB** | Allocated V8 JavaScript heap memory |
| **SQLite Storage Size** | **~76 KB** | Initial SQLite database file size (`dev.db`) |
| **Test Suite Execution** | **1.19s** | Time to execute 8 integration tests |

### 2. High-Concurrency Stress & Load Test Metrics
Simulates **1,500 database mutations & card operations** (creating 500 cards, updating metadata, moving across columns, adding comment feeds) in concurrent batches:

| Stress Test Metric | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Throughput / Speed** | **1,604 ops/sec** | 1,500 operations completed in **935ms** |
| **Peak RAM Usage (RSS)** | **166.52 MB** | Peak Resident Set Size memory under heavy burst load |
| **Peak Heap Memory Used** | **39.95 MB** | Peak V8 JavaScript heap during batch processing |
| **RAM Delta (Load vs Idle)** | **+88.25 MB** | Net RAM increase during 1,500 item concurrent burst |

### 🧪 How to Run Tests & Load Benchmarks Yourself

You can execute the automated tests, baseline benchmarks, or stress load tests locally at any time:

```bash
# 1. Run automated integration test suite (CRUD, JWT, Hashing)
yarn test

# 2. Profile baseline Node.js process RAM & SQLite database size
yarn benchmark

# 3. Execute high-concurrency memory load & throughput stress test (1,500 ops)
yarn load-test
```

## 📥 Importing an Existing Board (Vikunja)

Open Project Manager can pull a whole board — projects, kanban buckets, cards,
labels, priorities, due dates and comment history — out of another tool through
the import framework in `src/lib/import/`. A **Vikunja** adapter ships in the box.

Configure the source on the **server** (never in the request, so an API token
holder cannot point the importer at an arbitrary host):

```bash
VIKUNJA_URL=http://localhost:3456/api/v1  # Or http://<your-vikunja-host>:3456/api/v1
VIKUNJA_API_TOKEN=your-vikunja-read-token
VIKUNJA_IMPORT_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com  # the only OPM account allowed to import over the API
```

The Vikunja token is server-wide, so the API route only accepts imports from the
account named in `VIKUNJA_IMPORT_USER_EMAIL`; without it, use the command line below.

Then trigger it. Always dry-run first — it writes nothing and reports exactly what
would be created:

```bash
# Dry run
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPM_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "vikunja", "projectIds": [2], "dryRun": true}'

# Live import (omit projectIds to import every project the source token can see)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPM_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "vikunja", "projectIds": [2]}'
```

On the machine that owns the database you can skip the API token entirely and run
the same import from the command line:

```bash
VIKUNJA_URL=http://localhost:3456/api/v1 VIKUNJA_API_TOKEN=… \
  npx tsx scripts/import-vikunja.ts --user you@example.com --project 2 --dry-run
```

Every imported entity is recorded in `ImportRecord`, so **the import is safe to
re-run**: previously imported rows come back `skipped` instead of duplicating, and
a partially failed run is fixed by simply calling it again.

How Vikunja concepts land in OPM:

| Vikunja | Open Project Manager |
|---|---|
| Project | Project |
| Kanban bucket | Column (the view's `done_bucket_id` becomes `isDone`) |
| Task | Card (done tasks are forced into the done column, keeping `done_at` as `completedAt`) |
| Priority `0…5` | `NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT, URGENT` |
| Label (instance-wide) | Project label — only labels the imported tasks actually use |
| Comment | Comment, keeping the original author and timestamp |
| HTML description | Markdown (OPM renders descriptions with `react-markdown`) |

Adding another source is one adapter implementing `Importer` (`src/lib/import/types.ts`)
plus one line in the `SOURCES` registry in `src/app/api/v1/import/route.ts`.

## ⚡ AI Assistant Skills (`/opm` for Claude Code & Antigravity)

Open Project Manager provides a standardized skill bundle and `/opm` slash commands for **Claude Code** and **Antigravity**. You can manage tasks, transition cards across Kanban columns, and drive feature development directly from your coding assistant:

```bash
# Install skills into your project
yarn install-skills
```

- `/opm list`: View project columns and tasks.
- `/opm move <card> <column>`: Move cards between columns (e.g. Backlog -> To Do -> In Progress -> Done).
- `/opm develop <card>`: Automatically assign task, move to In Progress, load requirements, and guide code implementation.
- `/opm comment <card> <message>`: Add comments and status notes directly from the assistant.

See the comprehensive [AI Assistant Skills Guide](docs/skills.md) for full setup instructions and connection modes.

---

## 🤖 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Open Project Manager natively supports **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing external AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, Antigravity, custom agents) to inspect and manage workspace elements over **Stdio transport** or **REST API endpoints**.

### 1. Local Stdio Integration (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Antigravity)
Run the built-in MCP server via command line or add it to your local AI tool configuration:

```bash
yarn mcp
```

**Example `mcpServers` Configuration (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Antigravity):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-project-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tsx", "scripts/mcp-server.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/open-project-manager"
    }
  }
}
```

Stdio connections have no authenticated session, so tools that create data scoped to a user (e.g. `create_project`) require an explicit `userId` argument from the calling client — there is no fallback identity.

### 2. Remote REST API for LLM Models (`/api/v1/mcp/*`)

Remote LLMs and HTTP clients can call MCP tools over REST API endpoints:

#### List Available MCP Tools
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mcp/tools
```

#### Execute an MCP Tool over REST
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mcp/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool": "create_card",
    "arguments": {
      "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
      "columnId": "COLUMN_ID",
      "title": "Build AI feature",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "points": 5,
      "owner": "AI Agent"
    }
  }'
```

#### Read MCP Resource over REST
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mcp/resources?uri=opm://projects"
```

#### JSON-RPC 2.0 Endpoint over HTTP
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mcp/jsonrpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list_projects",
      "arguments": { "isArchived": false }
    }
  }'
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Open Project Manager provides an official multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployments with standalone Next.js builds and SQLite data persistence.

### 1. Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

#### Option A: SQLite (Zero-Config Default)
Run the application in the background with persistent SQLite storage. `docker-compose.yml` requires a `JWT_SECRET` in a `.env` file next to it:

```bash
# Create a .env with a real secret
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env

# Build and launch container
docker compose up -d

# (Optional) Seed demo user accounts and sample project boards
docker compose run --rm migrate npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop container
docker compose down
```

`docker compose up -d` first runs a one-shot `migrate` service (`prisma migrate deploy` against the
`opm_data` volume) before starting the app, so the database schema is always in sync on a fresh
deployment.

#### Option B: PostgreSQL (Opt-In)
For production setups with an integrated or centralized PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Create a .env with a real secret
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env

# Build and launch application alongside Postgres 16
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d

# (Optional) Seed demo user accounts and sample project boards
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml run --rm migrate npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml logs -f

# Stop containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml down
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 2. Standalone Docker Build & Run
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t open-project-manager .

# Apply the database schema to the volume (one-time, and after any migration)
docker build --target migrator -t open-project-manager:migrator .
docker run --rm \
  -v opm_data:/app/data \
  -e DATABASE_URL="file:/app/data/dev.db" \
  open-project-manager:migrator

# Run container with volume mount for persistent SQLite database
docker run -d \
  --name open-project-manager \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v opm_data:/app/data \
  -e DATABASE_URL="file:/app/data/dev.db" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  open-project-manager
```

### Changing the schema
Schema changes go through Prisma migrations, not `db push`. After editing `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <describe-the-change>
```

Commit the generated `prisma/migrations/` folder — `migrate deploy` (run automatically by the
`migrate` service above) only applies migrations that are already committed.

## 🔄 Upgrading & Updating Open Project Manager

Open Project Manager includes an automated update utility in `deploy/update.sh` (or `yarn update`) designed for zero-downtime and zero data loss on Linux servers, Raspberry Pis, and homelabs.

### 1. View Available Tags & Releases
```bash
./deploy/update.sh --list
```
This fetches upstream git tags and displays your currently running version alongside newer releases.

### 2. Update to a Specific Tag or Latest Main
```bash
# Update to a specific release tag (e.g. 0.2.0):
./deploy/update.sh 0.2.0

# Or update to latest commits on main:
./deploy/update.sh main
```

### What the Update Script Does:
1. **Zero Data-Loss Snapshot**: Creates an atomic SQLite hot backup (`dev.db.<timestamp>.bak`) and archives `.env` into `backups/` before touching any code.
2. **Tag Checkout**: Fetches and checks out the requested git tag or branch.
3. **Dependency Sync**: Runs `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` with network timeout resilience.
4. **Database Migrations**: Deploys pending Prisma schema migrations to `dev.db`.
5. **Memory-Safe Standalone Build**: Enforces swap availability and passes `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"` to compile safely on 1GB RAM hardware without memory exhaustion.
6. **Asset Sync & Service Restart**: Synchronizes standalone public/static assets and automatically restarts the systemd service (`open-project-manager.service`).
